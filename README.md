# OneMoreTetris
Simple Tetris in Unity.

It is a very simple implementation of tetris.
Almost all staff is configurable.
Class Game is a main entry point.
It should adapt to any resolution (because it is non optimized and uses Unity UI)

I spent me 6h 31 min to implement it. (And I planned to do it in 3h but failed miserably)
